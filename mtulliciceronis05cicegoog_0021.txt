made for every speech the most careful and conscientious
preparation, and handled his subjects with the most con-
summate skill. He could confuse a thing when he chose,
and weave a web oi sophistry almost impossible to disen-
tangle. What he wished to make clear he could put in the
simplest, plainest, most forcible way, and he generally did
· 9it in the shortest sentences. He could be humorous, sarcas-
tic, pathetic, ironical, satirical, and when he was malignant ,
his mouth was most foul and his bite most venomous. His
orations are distinguished by variety and rapid change of
sentiment. His delivery was impassioned and fiery, his
voice strong, full, and sweet, his figure tall, graceful,
and impressive. He possessed awonderful influente over ·
the sensas and feelings oi his hearers, and when other
counsel were associated with him it was usual for Cicero to
’ be the last to address the jury. By universal consent he is ξ
placed side by side with Demosthenes, or at least close ³
after him. He surpassed the great Attic orator in variety l

Chatham and Burke, Webster, Everett, and Choate, have ·
all felt and own⁰ed the powerful influence oi his example.

We know of over one hundred orations which he deliv-
ered; fifty-seven have been preserved entire, some twenty
others in a fragmentary condition. We donet have them,
however, in the precise form in which they were delivered,
because it was his custom to prepare his speeches for pub-
lication by removing the parts ot less permanent interest,
and revising the rest.
