mun OF CICERO.

in Roman eyes—they had summoned a foreign people
to arms against their country, and had contemplated calling

up the hordes of slaves against their masters. Iu a well-
ordered commonwealth this would have been enough - the
punishment of high treason has always in all communities
been death. The civil courts would have dealt with the
leaders in the city, aud the army with Catilina in the field.

it was doubtful if the criminals could be held for trial.

the third place, grauting that the prisoners could be held fcr

ceased to be inflicted. In ordinary practice ¹a criminal who
looked upon his conviction as certain, was allowed to

exile (ὅ 20), but the courts no more imposed exile as a
¹ penalty than our courts now banish defaulters to Canada.
The criminal, by a legal fiction, left his country of his own i
