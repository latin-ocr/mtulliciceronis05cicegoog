His Pos1r1ow rw Lmnnnrunn. -Το the pursuit of litera-e
ture Oioero brought extraordinary intellectual oapabilities‚
a strong imagination, refined and eleveted testes, and habits
of application that exuite our amazement. His learning
was great, - Varro alone of his contemporaries surpassed
him, -and to the end of his life he read and studied inoes-
