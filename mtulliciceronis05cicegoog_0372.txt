remarkable. The tabellarii travelled irom iorty ιο ditymiles a day
in carta, and irum twenty-six to twenty-seven on inot. Under lavor·

able conditione much better time was possible: a letter could go irom
Rome to Brundisium (three hundred and severity mill. paea.) ln ilva
days, on to Dyrrhachium in live more, reaching Athens in twenty-one
days irorn its departurc3 and letters irom Caesar in Britain reached
Cicero in Rome ln irom twenty-seven ιο thirty-iourdays. In the time

11. Wnrrme iteraremus. For ordinary briei communicatione gt,
the Romans used tablets (tabellae) made oi iirwood or ivory. These
were oi various eires, iasteued together in sets oi two or more by wire
hinges. ¹ The inner iaces were slightly hollowed out, and the depres-
sion was nearly iilled with wax, eo as to leave a raised rim about the
adges. Upon the wax letters were traoed withan ivory or metal tool
(stilus, propitium) having one end pointed like a pencil ior wrlting, aud
the other ilat, like a paper-cutter, for smoothlug the war. With this
ilat end mistakes could be corrected, or the whole letter erased and
the tabellae prepared ior use on other occasions.

For longer communicatione another material (papyrus) was used, 55,
resembling our peper, but rough and coarse. lt was made irom the
reed oi the same name, obtained in Egypt. Upon this papyrus, or
charta, they wrote with e pen made oi a split reed (colamus) and lnk
(atroiueutum) made of soot mixed with resinous guma. The inlr
could be washed oli with a damp eponge, which the writer kept by
him ior the correction oi errors. The tendency ol the poor ink to
blot and spread upon the poorer paper accounts ior the continued nse
oi the bulky tabellae.

These rude writing materiale, and the extensive correspondente id.
carried ou by every Roman oi birth and position, made lt impossible
ior him to write any but the most important oi his letters, or those to
his dearest friends, with his own hand. ,The place oi tha stenographer
and typewriter oi today was taken by slaves or iraedmen, often
highly educated, who wrote at the dictation of the mester. Such
slaves were called iu general terms librarii, more particularly seiri ub
epistolis, serui α mauu, or amanuenses.

letter, -the date, address. salutation, body, compllmentary close, and
signatura, —ths addi-ess and complimentary close are entirely wam-
ing in Latin letters, and the dete is but rarely given. The delivery
oi the letters by special messeugers (5 i) made the date and address
less necessary than now, and the sti-alghtiorwerdness oi the Latin
language knew no such meaningless phrases as our ‘your obedient
servant,’ ‘yourstruly,’ ‘yours, etc!

The nura when expressed will be found attha end oi the 58.
