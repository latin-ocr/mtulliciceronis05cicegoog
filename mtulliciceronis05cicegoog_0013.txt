1.,11., for Murena, against Catiline, HL, IV, for Sulla, for
Sestius, and for Milo. -The period between the Sulla and
Sestius ie covered by a selection ot twenty-three Letters,
equivalent to three of the ehorter orations usually given.
The amount of text ie greater than in any other school edition,
and the student will find in the specioue reaeoning ot the

Sulla, the despairing weakness of the Letters, and the passion· ’

ate seli-justification of the Sestius, better material for an
estimate of Cicero’e character than in the Manilian Law, the
Archiae, the Marcellus, and the one or two Philippice which
they have displaced. In the tent edition, however, which

1 accompanies this, I have included the Manilian Law and the

Archias for the purpose of giving material for reading at
sight and with dictated notes. ¹

Il. 'l'he Introductory Mattcr is much fuller than in similar
books. Itis divided into two parts: The first contains the
lit'e of Cicero and an estimate of his character, together with
an unusually lull account ot the events which are treated of in
the orations and letters following. The second part contains
an outline of the Roman constitution as it was in Cicero's

time. It has eeemed to me better to put this matter in a

connected form, however imperfect it may be, than to 'scatter
it through the book in the form of introductione and notes to

the several orations. The matter is divided' into sectione,
which are numbered, and to these sections reference ie con·
stantly made in the notes. The teacher should have the
second part merely read over in the class-mom, making euch
explanatione and adding euch illustratione as may be neces-
sary. The first part should then be assigned for study in
convenient lessons as far ae ξ 50 before commencing to read
the firet oration; the reet may be taken in order as directed
