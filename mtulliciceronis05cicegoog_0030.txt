but was afterwards restored. To him Catilina attached ³5
himself, and both resolved to leave untried no means of can-
vassing, lawlnl or unlawful, to defeat Cicero - of the other
candidates they had no fears. Catilina found friends to
assist him with their money and credit in tho purchase of
votes, and at the expense ot other friends shows of gladia· j
tors were promised the people in his name. Finally, in ⁴
dune Catilina called together his trusted adherents and
laid before them his plans and the means of executing
them. To the ambitione he promised high positions in the
state, to the bankrupt complete or partial relicf by legisla-
tion, to all alike the rich spoil of an unscrnpulous adminis-
tration and the plunder oi the provinces. All was condi·
tioned of course upon his success in the electiori of the
following month; and so, after ratifying their engagements
with the most fearfnl oaths (it is said that they pledged
each other· in wine mixed with human blood), they separ-

C1cnno’s Carnona-While Catilina was indulging in 36
the most confident hopes, the prospects of Cicero were by
no means bright. He could count certainly upon the sup
port of the knights only-the order to which his own
family belonged. For however great the reputation he had
made as an orator, advocate, and administrator, however
high he stood in the affectione oi the people, however pure ι
his character was amidst the moral filth oi the time, how·
ever persuasively he urged his own claime, and however
eloquently he exposed the designs of his opponents, still
the arts oi his competitors wera strong with the lower
classes and the nobility was solidly against him. The
nobles despised him as a homo novas (p. 56, ἓ 16), hated him
for his attacks upon them in his speeches against Verres
and ior the Manilian law (5 23), and fearad that in the
future he might work in the interests of the democrats,
and further the ambitious designs of Pompeius.
