Tan Araura or Cnonrus.- But toward the close of the 73
year 62 occurred a circumstance that excited party strife
again, and exercised the most baneful influence over
Cicero's later fortunas. P. Clodius Pulcher (ἓ 33), a young
manos ancient and noble family, but guilty of all sorts oi
arcessas, in prosecution of an intrigue with Caesans wife,
ventured to disguise himself as a danoing-girl, and steal
into Caesar's official residence at the time when the myster-
ies of the Bona Dec, at which the presence of men was
strictly forbidden, were being celebrated there. Caesar
was then pontisas mocimus (ξ 39), but absent as propraetor
in Spain. Clodius was detected, but escaped. 'l'he high

priests declared the act sacrilegious, and required the
matrons and vestals to repeat the rites. Besides this the
senate ordered a jndicial inquiry, and for the purpose of
securing greater rigor resolved that the jurors should be
selected by the praetor, and not, as was usual, be drawn by
lot. This required the assent of the people, and party ⁷⁴

feeling prolonged the discussion into the year 61 when the
senate was defeated. The jurors were selected by lot, aud
the money of Crassus, who, in concert with Caesar, used
every opportunity to humiliate the senate, secured the η
aequittal of Clodius by a vote oi thirtyone to twenty-five.
'Cicero had from the beginning championed the cause of
the senate, but without personal bitterness toward Clodius.
Now, however, ior reasons unknown to ns, he suddenly be·
came his most vindictive foe. He not only destroyed dur·
ing the trial the attempted alibi by testiiying that Clodius
was at his house when he claimed to be miles from Rome,
but after the verdiot was rendered he let no opportunity
pass totwit him with the crime and the trial. Clodius
soon went to Sicily as quaestor, but he had resolved on
revenge‚ and was merely biding his time.
