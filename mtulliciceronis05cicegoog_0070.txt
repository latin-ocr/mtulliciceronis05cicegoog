shoulder the fasoer, a bundle of rods typifying the consul's
right to soourge. Originally an axe had been bound up ⁵⁵
with the rods, but this was not carried in the city after
the granting of the ius provocationis (ξ 3). The consuls
retained as exconsuls (moratores) much of their dignity,
took precedence of other senators in debete, were alone
eligiole to certain positions of honor, and gave their names

elected from the maculares (§ 55), originally at the mini·
mum interval of four years, afterwards once in five years

teen months. Their duties were of three kinds: (a) they
took the masas, which was a register oi the citizens with
their familias and the amount of their property, fixed, in
accordance with this census, the position of each citizen
in his tribe, class, and century, and filled vacancies in the

· senate. (b) They had a general oversight of public morals, 5⁷
and could punish any citizen for scandalous conduct by
removing him, if a senator or knight, from his ordo (ἐξ 14,
20), or if acommoner, to a lower class in his tribe, or even
into the ranke of the aerarii (ξ 30). (c) They had general
oversight of the public bnances, collected the revenuesse
by “larming” them to the highest bidders, let out con·
tracts for public works, and superintended their construc-
tion. During the interval between the abdication of one
board ol censore and the eleotion of their successore these
last duties were delegated by the senate to the consuls,
praetors, aediles, or other magistrates.

tion in civil cases between Roman citizens was called
practor- urboacs; the one having civil jurisdiction between
