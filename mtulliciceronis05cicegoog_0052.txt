while they reveal his impatience to be recalled and his
injustice to Atticus and other friends, it must be remem-
bered, on the other hand, that Cicero's nature was keenly
sensitive, and thathis pride had been most cruelly wounded.
All that he had was taken from him3 all the cherished
occupations of his life were over3 and, sc far as he could
know at the timebis doubts and fears were justified. The
expression of these doubts and fears may be open to
criticism as a matter of teste, but the Roman feeling in
regard tc such matters differed widely from curs. They
did not effect a fortitude they did not have3 they did not,

his great hero Aeneas weep in stcrm and despair in battle,
it is not worth while to make excuses for similar weakness

town residence (ἓ 80) was restored to him, and damages
paid for the destruction of his house and villas. In 56 he
was busy as an advocate, taking but an insignifioant part .
in affairs of state. The rival faotions were employing the
cour-ts to annoy each other; suits and counter-suits were
brought in rapid succession, and Cicero had ample opportu-
nity to defend his friends and assail his enemies.
