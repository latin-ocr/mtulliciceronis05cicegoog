tically no burdens imposed by citizenship. The citizen was
theoretically liable for military duty from his llth to his
ceth year, and to pay atax if such was found necessary in
time of war. Since the time of Marius, however, citizens
110 longer served iu the army against their will, and the rich

· ravenues from the provinces made taxation unnscessary even

iu time of war.

Entirely outside the pale of citizenship, and forming, of9
course, no part of the Populus Romanus, were two numerous
elements in the population of the city, foreigners (Pare
grani) and slaves (Serri). The persons and property of
the former were secured by law, though they might at any
time be removed from the city by vote of the people. Slaves
were loolred upon as mere property, and had no rights of
,any sort.

II. Crass Drsrrrrorrorrs. -Although the government of10
Rome is called republican, and although the old distinction
between patriciaus aud plebeians had long since ceased to be
of political importance, still there were differentes of posi· ·
tion between even the cives optimo iare that are entirely
foreign to our ideas of republican equality. 'Phe govern- 11
ment was really aristocratic; and the preservation of its
democratia features was due solely to 'the fact that there
were two aristocracies, one of office-holders aud the other
oi capitalists, which struggled most bitterly with each other
during the last years of the Republic.

a The Noblcs. - The Roman nobility was now an 12
hereditary rank, based not upon birth but upon the hold-
ing of office. Any man who held any curule office, i.e.,
any dictator, consul, censor, praetor, or curule aedile, secured
to his descendants to the last generation the right (ius
imaginum) to display in their halis and carry at funerals a
wax mask representing his features. The possession oi 1³
such a maak, or in other words deseent from a curule
magistrate, was the patent of nobility, and all descendants
ol curule magistrates were, therefore, nobles (cotilas).
