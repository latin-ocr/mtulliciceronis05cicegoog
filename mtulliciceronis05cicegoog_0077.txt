87 Similarly, generals before going on a campaign took the
auspices on the Capitol, and were said to “carry their
auspices '' with them; if they were unsuccessful, they weie
thought to have “lost their auspices‚'’ and had in early
days to return to Rome for new ones (crespioio repetere).
The inconvenience of this rule ,led to the invention of a

new method of taking auspices, by watching the feeding
of sacred chickens which the general took along with him

wherever he went. Hence the classification of magistrates
in ἕ 45, ΙΙΙ.

, 88 To both the augur and the magistrate the auspices were

a source of great political poweru So minute and intricate
were the rules and regulations of augury, that a zealous
augur could pick a flaw in almost any auspices„ and thus'
effectually prevent action on the part of magistrate, senate,
and people. And besides, it was a principle of augural
law, confirmed by statute law, that no action could be taken
by a magistrate if he was notified that another was en·
gaged in taking auspices. This was because it was thought

89 that the will of the gods was not yet fully ascertained. If
therefore a magistrate gave notice that on a certain day, or
series of days, he intended to “ watch the heavens''' (sor-
oaro de caelo), none of the acts requiring auspices (5 84)
could be performed on that day or that series of days. This
notice was called obnuntiatio, and was frequently employed
against an obstinate tribune by magistrates who had other·

sowise no power over him (ἓ 72), as well as by the other
magistrates against each other. From this it will be seen
that a position in the college ofaugurs wasone to be
eoveted by men of the greatest dignity and highest rank-
Cicero himself became a member of the college ten years
after his consulship. 'l'he insignia of the office were the
toyu praetecta, the purple striped tunic (trabea), and a
curved staff (li uus).
