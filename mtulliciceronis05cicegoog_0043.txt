HFE OF* CICERO,

ators one by one until it came Caesar's turn. He proposed
imprisonment for life in the country towns with contisce-
tion of property, and in an eloquent speech dwelt upou the

uuoonstitutionality of putting the men to death untried, ’
' and upon the vengeance the people would surely exact
from the consul who should thus disregard their ancient
right to impose the sentence. His speech turned the eide.
All who followed him, including Cicero's brother, voted
with him, and many who had followed Silanus changed
- their votes. The consul’s friends crowded around his
cheir· imploring him to think of his own safety and lend
67 his eloquence to the support of the safer proposal, All
eyes were turned upon him as he rose to speak, as the con·
sul had a right to do at any point in the debete. Without
giving his voice outright for either proposal, he declared
his belief that the prisonem, by confessing themselves
hostes, had lost their rights as oioes, and urged ,the senators
to take no thought of his safety‚ hut consider the interests

of the state only. Still the senate wavered, andthe decis·
ion was about to be postponed, when Cato in a vigorous

speech declared for death. The majority followed him,
and that night the five ringleaders were strangled in the
Tullianam, the dungeon beneath the prison. ,

act broke the backbone of the conspiracy. From this
moment Catilina received no accessione of strength, and ·
his followers even began to desert him. His attempted
retreat with his army into Gaul was blooked hythe praetor
Metellus Celer (f 47), while M. Petreius, the legatus of
Antonius (ξ 53), advanced against him from the south.
Early in 62, when Cicero's year of office had expired, the
opposing forces met near Pistoris in Etruria. Catilina and
his followers, after fighting with the most desperate cour-
age, were defeated and elain to a man. The body of their

leader was found far in advauce of his men covered hya
heap of dead soldiers that he had killed with his own
hand.
