judicial authority in criminal cases, but had delegated it
to the standing courts. It had the power of declaring
war, but had allowed the senate to usurp this function
³2 The same method oi voting was used in all assemblies.
In the cornitio tributo the people arranged themselves by
tribes in enclosnres (samio) marked cii by ropes or other
barricrs. Each citizen was supplied with tickets marked
“for '² and “against '' when a law was proposed, or with the
names of the candidates when an eleetion was in prog-
asress. One tribe (tritos praerogativa) was selected by lot
to vote first; and the members of that tribe passed out ot
’ the saepto one by one through a narrow opening (pons),
each depositing his ticket in a box provided for the pur-
aepose. The vote oi this tribe was immediately announced
to the remaining thirty-four, and (as the gods were supposed
to direct the lot) it was usually confirmed by a majority of
the others. The rest of the tribes then voted in the same
manner as the first, but 'at the same time, and the matter

was decided bya majority (eighteen) of the tribal votes. ι ’

³⁵ The comitio centuriata went through similar formalities.
The people were arranged, each century to itself, around
the sides of the Campus Martius, a large space ,being left
unocoupied in the contre. The seventy centuries oi the
first and wealthiest class cas't lots to sec which should vote
first (contario praeroqattoa), and the result of its vote was

asannounced. Then the remaining centurias oi the first

, class (sixty-nine) and the eighteen centuries of nobles(§ 30)
voted at the same time. The other classes followed in order
of wealth; but with each of these four classes voted an extra
century made up of citizens who had arrived too late to vote
with their proper centurias, thus making a total oi three
hundred and seventy-scven votes, a majority of which
decided the matter.

bodies. They could assemble only when called together
