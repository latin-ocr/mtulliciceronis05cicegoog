HIS CONSULSHIP.

lius, Gabinius, and Cethegus fell into the trap, but Cassius
explained that he was scon going to Gaul in pe1·s0n,and
immediately left the city. The envoys also secured letters
from the conspirators to Catilina, by pretending that they
meant to turn aslde to sechim on their journcy. Finally,
on the night of the 2d of December, they left Rome, having
all these damaging documents in their possession, aud
accompanied by Τ. Volturcius who was to gulde them to
Catilina. In accordante with apre-arranged plan, they
were arrested not far from the city gates, where the aiu

some show of violence was made tc shield the Allobroges

tells us that the lower classes who had sympathized with
Catilina more or less openly, now cursed him when they
understood that their hereditary enemieS, the Gauls, had
been summoned to burn the city over their heads,

Tan Pitumnum-The fate of the conspirators was 61
now to be determined. Their guilt had been fully estah
lislred. lt was proved that they had formed a conspiracy
against the government, that they had planned an uprising
with torch aad sword, that-a still more heincus offence
