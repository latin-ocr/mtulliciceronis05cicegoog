71 Tur 00111011 roa Souna—Meanwhile in the early
months 01 62 the ordinary criminal law was set in motion
against several 01 Catilina's party, whose guilt was 101 the ’
10001 part 01001. Among them were Autronius (5 30) who
vainly appealed to Cicero once his colleague in the quaes·
torship, Servius and Publius Sulla, nephews 01 the dicta
tor, M. Porcius Laeca, at whose house (§ 49) the famous
meeting was held, Lucius Vargunteius and Gaius Cornelius ν
the would-be murderers 01 Cicero. Against all these
Cicero gave evidence and none were acquitted. When four
years later he was driven from Rome, Autronius was living
in Epirus in exile. About the middle 01 the year, prob
ably in July, occurred the trial 01 P. Cornelius Sulla on,
the chargeof eomplicity in the First Conspiracy (11 30- 1
32). Since his conviction 101 bribery he had been living 10
retirement, almost constantly at Naples, though an effort

⁷2 had been made to remove his politioal disabilities. He was
prosecuted by Τ. Manlius Torquatus, son 01 the consul who
had been elected 10 his place, and by C. Cornelius, 000 01
the conspirator of the same name, and known from Cicero's
speech only. Oioero's reason 101 undertaking the defenoe
does not appear upon the surface. He alleges his desire 10
,aida 1000 whom hehad good 1000000 101 believing innocent,
¹his anxiety to show that· he could 00 due occasion be mer-
0110100 well as 0010100 00111101 impulse to aet with the
most distinguished men 01 the day, who had turned their
baohs upon Vargunteius and the rest, but warmly supported
Sulla. His real reason was that he was casting about for
friends in the troubles plainly approaching. Sulla's wealth
and 1011110000 11010 very considerable, and Cicero was
anxious to lay him and his poweriul friends under an obli·

gation. With Cicero was associated Hortensius (5 56). ,
Sulla was acquitted, but we know little 01 his subsequent
career.
