trun OF CICERO.

the same day by one M. Tullius Albiovanns with a breach
of the peace (de ei), because he had gone about as tribune
with armed bands disturbing the public tranquillity. Of
the former charge nothing further is known. Cicero is
concerned with the latter only, and to this he pays little
formal attention. His 'object is rather to give an outline
of his client's life and character, and especially of his tribn-
nate, in such away as to bring before the court any circum·
stance that might favorably influence its decision. Iu this
historical survey we have the fullest possible account of
the disorders of the time, from the standpoint of the con-
servatives. The trial lasted with interruptions until the
ruth of March, ending with the acquittal of Sestius.

88 'fun Dnnrn ou (luemus—The events of the next four
years, 55-52, have little to do with the conspiracy of
Catilina, however important their part in the history ost
Rome; among them may be mentioned Caesar’s conquest
of Gaul, the defeat and death of Crassus in the east, the
death of J ulia, the daughter oi Caesar and wife of Pompeius,
and the consequent estrangement oi the two great rivale.
During the absence of Caesar in Gaul and Crassus in the
east, Pompeius was in Rome, and everything pointed to his
supremacy. As proconsules Spain and as commissioner of
the corn supply he was invested with the highest military
authority, and by remaining at Rome he made his influ-
ence promptly felt. An event now occurred that made his
power still greater. The year 53 had passed in contentiori,
and disorder. Party dissensione had been so violent and
unscrupulous that no magistrates had been elected for the

89 following year. On the lst of danuary, 52, there were no
consuls to be inaugurated. Milo wasone of the candidates,
but Clodius had found means to prevent his electiori. The
wheels of government had therefore stopped, and according
to constitutional usage a series of interreges had to be
appointed by patrician senators to set them in motion again.
