Atthis crisis it happened that Clodius and Milo met by
accident upon the nia Appio a few miles from the city, each
attended byhis gang of bullies and roughs. A quarrel
began among their lollowem, and a free fight followed.
Clodius was wounded and took refuge in a house near the
read, from which by Milo's orders he was dragged and mur·
dered. His body was carried to the city, and his funeral was
made the occasion of a disorderly politica] demonstration
The corpse was burned in the senate house, and the building
itself took fire and was consumed Anarchy ran riot, and
order was not restored until Pompeius, in defiance ol consti·
tution and lawa, was mado “sole consul ” and put an end to
the battle of bludgeons with the swords of his soldiers.
Tan Caranon roa Mum-A special commission was90

appointed to try all cases growing out ol the disturbance
on the Appian Way, and all the members of this commission
or court were selected by Pompeius. At the same time
all men capable of service in Italy were called to arms and
made to take the oath of obediende to Pompeius. Troops
were stationed at the Capitol, and the special court, sitting
in the lorum, was surrounded by soldiers. Before this
court on the 10th of April Milo was arraigned on the
charge ol assault and homicide. Cicero undertook his
defenoe for personal and politioal reasons. As he began
his speech he was received with hoots and yells by the par-
tisans of Clodius which the troops were unable to suppress.
The consequence was that, lor the first time in his long
career, he lost his composure and brohe down¹ Milo went
into exile at Massilia, whither Cicero sent him a carefully
polished (ξ 10) copy of the speech which he had intended
to deliver,and which we now possess Milo is said to have
replied on reading it that he was glad the speech had not
been spoken‚as in that case he should not have been enjoy-
ing the delicious mullets of Massilia. The oration in its
revised form is regarded as perhaps the very best specimen
of Cicero's eloquencc.
