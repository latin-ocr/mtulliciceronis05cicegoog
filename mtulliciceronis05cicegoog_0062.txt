the right oi serving on jurias, which had formerly belonged
to the senatorial order exclusively, to those persons not
senators who were worth not less than 400,000 sesterces
(020000). This gave tho state a new order; and the nobles,
presented by law from engaging in trade, found themselves
confronted by an aristocraoy of weahh, which they in
turnexcluded from political preferment. To this second 20
order the name Ordo Equester was given, not that it had
anything to do with military service, but because its census
(400,000 sesterces) was the same that had in early times
entitled a citizen to serve in the cavalry. The insiqnic of
the knights were a gold ring and the tucho anqusticlacz'o
(with two narrow purple stripes).

c. The Commoris. -Below the Nobles and the Knights 21
came the great mass of the citizens, the Commoris. They
did no't really form an order, had no insiynio, and no dis·
tinctive name. They were called slightingly the Plebs,
and flatteringly the Populos ,· but there were powerful
plebeian families among the knights and nobles, and both
these classes were also covered by the name Populus. The 22
condition of the commons in Cicero’s time was pitiable.
The combinatione oi capital shut them out of commeroe
and manufacture, while ‘the competition of slave labor

almost closed agriculture and the trades against them.
Some found employment in the colonies and provinces,

some eked out a scanty living on their farma, some made
war their trade, but the idle and degradod flooked into the
capital to live on the cheap corn provided by the treasury,
and to sell their votes to the highest bidder.

It must be remembered, however, that no citizen wacca
absolutely excluded from either oi the ordines. The
meanest citizen could become a Knight by amassing the
required sum of 400‚000 sesterces, and the poorest could
make himself a senator and his descendants noble by beat-
ing the senatorial candidate fora quaestorship, and then
gaining a curule office.
