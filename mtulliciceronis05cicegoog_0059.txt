4 Below the cives optimo inre came a numerous body, who
had either never enjoyed full citizenship, o‚r had lost it in
whole crin part. of the former the most important class
were the freed slaves (Libanai), who stood to their former
masters much asin earlier times the clients had stood
to the patricians. They were enrolled as cives, held prop-
erty and voted‚ but were practically denied the ias honorum
until the taint of their origin had been removed by several
generations. .

¹⁵ There were several ways in which a citizen might lose
someor all of his civitas. Conviction for certain offences
(infamia), or going into exile to avoid condemnation on a
capital charge, involved the loss of certain iura for life ;
while the censure of the Consors (ignominia) took away‘
certain rights during their term of office. citizenship was
altogether lost by the citizen's transferring'his allegiance
to another state, or by his being taken captive in war and
sold by the enemy into slavery.

6 From the standpoint of a magistrate each citizen was a
capnt, a political unit, and the loss of citizenship to a less
or greater extent was called Daminntio Capitis. Hence κ
such expressions as crimea capitale, indicium capitis, poena
capitis, do not mean a charge, trial, or punishment in which κ
the life of a citizen was at stake, bnt such a one as involved Ἴ
the whole or partial loss cf his civitas. It is very impor- l
tant to remembcr this when reading of Roman courts.

parents having the ias conubii, or was conferred hylan, or .
was (rarely) given by some duly authorized magistrate. A l
citizen born was enrolled as such on reaching his lvth ’
year, taking at once the class his father had, and thence-
forth enjoyed all his rights. These rights were in force
wherever in Roman territory he might take up his abode, f
