for murder, for at the head of a band of Gallio horse-
men he slew a number of Roman knights, among them his ’
, 27 brother-inlaw, Caecilius, and tortured to death a relative of
Cicero and Marius. He is supposed to have gone through
the regular course of offices (p. 69, § 77) at the regular
age for each. He was elected quaestor, and afterwards as
legatus conducted the siege of an enemy's town, but the

as one of the conservative (senatorial) candidates Upon
the conservatives, therefore, he visited his disappointment,
believingthat had their support been earnest and sineere, the

¹ prosecution might have been evaded or at least postponed.

He turned, therefore, to the democrats, the opposition, and

secured their support for his next attempt by putting for-

dared propose. Attention‚ however, was called from his
