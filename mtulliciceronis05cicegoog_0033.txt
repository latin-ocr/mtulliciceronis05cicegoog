η 42 'lun Ennomon or 63. - Cicero, who had kept accu-
rately informed of Catilina's designs, fully appreciated
the critical condition of the state. As Catilina had turned
from the democrats 1ο the anarchistS, so Cicero turned to
theconservatives. He tried 1ο win the confidence of the
senators, to open their eyes to the threatened danger, 1ο
arouse their energias in behalf of the republic which he
believed could be saved by the senate alone. To convince
them of his disinterestedness he had declined a province
in advance 01 the lots. The rich one, Macedonia, which
afterwards fell to him, he turned over to his doubtful

· colleague Antonius as a bribe 10 win him from his connec-
tion with Catilina, or at least 1ο secure his neutrality. The
less desirable one he caused to be given to a stanch con·

43 servative, Quintus Metellus Celer. He bribed Fulvia, and
through her Curius, to keep him informed of Catilina's
plots. To counteract his election intrigues he proposed
and carried through a law in reference 1ο bribery, adding
1ο the number of acts that were 'declared illegal, and in-
creasing the severity of the penalties. He looked to his
personal safety by forming a body-guard of friends and
clients, who also served him as a secret police. Finally, in
July, when news reached him of a secret meeting of
a particularly atrocious character, he called the senate
together the day before the electiori, arrd laid the danger
before them. The senate determined to discuss the condi-
tion of the state the next day instead of holding the eleo·
tion. This was done, and when Cicero had acquainted
them with 311 that he knew, he challenged Catilina to reply

4410 his charges. Nothing daunted, Catilina replied inan
exultant and defiant speech, for which, says Cicero,·he
ought'not to have been allowed 10 leave the house alive.
The senate, however, took no decisivo steps, the election

, was no longer deferred, and Catilina left the senate house
