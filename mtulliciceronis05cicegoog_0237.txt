510. vr. It will be noticed immediately that this, procedure differs
widely from ours. 'l'here was no professionally trained J'udge to siit
the evidence, and sum it up ior the jury. 'l'he quaesitores were
changedirom year to year, and the praetors at least were more apt to

d 11. be skiliul politiclans than learned jurists. 'l'here was no class of pro·
fessional advocates taking fees and living by their profession. Any
citizen might accuse or defend any other, and, as a high reputation as
a successful pleader helped a man to political distinction, many did
so. 'l‘hus the relations oi counsel to cliente rested more than now

sla. upon the grounds oi personal feeling. Again it not infrequently
happened that collusion existed between the accuser and thc accused.
'l'hc former frequently played into the hands oi the latter by sup-
pressing evidence, and conducting the case without energy (praevari-
catio), and hence the chief security for an honest prosecution lay in

513. the persoual hostility oi the two. Then no hounds were set to the
matter oi an advocate’s speech. 'l'he time might be limited hy
the judge or by agreement, but the only measure oi relevancy was
the patience of the· jury. Ιι is saie to say that a modern judge would
not allow half of any of Cicero's speeches ιο reach the ears of the
jury. Lord Brougham declares that not one-sixth oi the oration for
Archias would be admissible in an English court. Great importance
was therefore attached ιο an advocate's skill asan orator, and as
much, perhaps ιο his personal iufluence with thc jury, and his posi-

514. tion in the state. Other means, too, were employed ιο work upon the
feelings oi the Jury. 'l'he accused was attended by crowds oi friends, ”
his wiie, children, and parents surrounded him, and he and they wore '

⁴ old and filthy garments as a sign of mourning, Influential men
were secured to testify in general terms to his character, memoriola
were presented from distant communitieS, and deputations were often

§la present throughout the trial. Finally, bribery was too common ιο
excite surprise, and was made all the easier because the jury was,
accessible to the agents oi both parties instead of being kept apart
as non. We may therefore conclude that while the Roman criminal
law was administered more expeditiously than ours, it was not irae
irom objectiouable features.
