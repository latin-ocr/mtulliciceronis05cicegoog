the others had jurisdiction in criminal cases, presiding
over six ol the quaestiones perpetuae, “standing courts.''
60The praetor urbanus was at the head of the Roman judi·

' cial system, and while possessing no more real power than
his colleagues was‘looked upon as of superior dignity.
During the absence of both consuls from the city he pre·
sided over the senate. All the praetors had the right to
sumrnon the senate and comitio, and each was attended in
