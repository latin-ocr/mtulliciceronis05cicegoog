Trrrs edition of Cicero's Orations and Letters is intended

“ease'' “merit'’ or “interest” I have, therefore, tried to

spiracy of Catilina as the main theme, following it up with
Cicero’s Exile and his Feud with Clodius. The period covered
is only from one-third to one-half as long as the usual one,

given are arranged in chronological order: Against Catilina,
