the orations and letters are taken as arranged in the book and
the Introduction as suggested above. 1 am sure that these
three principles ¹are pedagogically sonnd, whether or notI
have successfully applied them.

V. The Vocabulary is intended 10 0001010 all the words
found in the text here given, and in addition all those in
Verres Ι., Philippica XIV, Archiae, Marcellus, Deiotarus, and
the Manilian Law, editions 01 which I hope to furnish 0000
1010000101000101)1 reading. I shall be grateful to the student
who will call my attention to words omitted.

VI. The Index will be found 000101 forpurposes 01 reference
aud topical study.

¹VII. Passages for Retranslation have not been included
iu the book, as it seemed wisest to have them in a separate
manual. An excellent little book of this kind has been
prepared by Professor J. D. S. RiggS‚ 01 Granville Academy‚
whose In Latinam has already been introduced into many 01 ⁸
our schools.

No claim is made for originality in the matter here given.
Ihave drawn freely from all sources accessible 10 100, chiefly
English and German. Besides the standard Histories 01
Rome and Latin Literature, aud the Dictiouaries 01 An-
tiquities, I have used for the introduction· the biography 01

010010 by Troilope, Gow's Compauion to school Classica, and

1110 introductione to the editions mentioned below. For the
Notas, I have used the editions 01 the several orations and
letters by Halm dc Laubmann, and Hofmann& Anderson in
Weidmanu's series, by Richter, Koch, Eberhard, Landgraf,
aud Frey in Teubner’s series, by Hachtmann and Bouterwek
in tho Gotho series, by Reid, Heitlaud, and Purton 10 the
Pitt Press series, by Willrins and Hcldeu in Macmillan's .
